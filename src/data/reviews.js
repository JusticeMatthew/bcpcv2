      "Used to live in Lake Mary Manderley and this was by far the best pest control company I've come across. The attention to detail in all aspects (admin, handling the account, knowledge of pests, performing the service,  proper treatment considering our pets, even billing) was exceptional.  Pricing was more than reasonable and better than most. Miss having them and I wish they could service my new home in Minnesota.",

Before using B&C I did not think it was possible to live completely bug-free in Florida.  Thanks to B&C I do now!  We just never see a bug - from one annual visit to the next!  B&C truly earns 5 stars!',
